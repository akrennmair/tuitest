============

Name
----
tt-record - run automated tests of text user interfaces

Synopsis
--------
tt-record [-f] [-x] <script> <command>

Introduction
------------

tuitest is a tool to create an run automated tests of text user interfaces.  It
is meant as a complement to the widespread use of unit tests, and uses concepts
known from GUI testing tools with the difference that it applies them
specifically to text- and terminal-based user interfaces.

tt-record is the binary to run a console tool (being the 'command' in the
command line) and generate a ruby script (being 'script') which can be used to
replay the recorded session.

Options and environment variables
---------------------------------

*-f*::
    Enable fast mode. Do not respect exact timings but execute it as fast as
    possible.

*-x*::
    Provide a junit compatible XML file (RESULT-$script.xml) when running the recorded session.
    The XML file can then be used in tools like for example hudson.

Usage examples
---------------

  % tt-record output.rb vim

Run the console editor Vim and save the unit testing script as output.rb.
Then execute 'ruby ./output.rb' to replay the recorded session.
